The goal is to maneuver your offensive units into a position to attack and destroy the enemy base. Your offensive units lack any 
mobility of their own and must rely on your worker units to push and pull them into position. If you lose all your offensive units 
then you lose the game, however: worker units are expendable and can be replaced at your landing zone (blue area) using the worker 
production factory. Workers also serve to provide vision for your artillery to shoot as they can't hit through fog of war.

Interact with the Left Mouse Button (LMB) by clicking on GUI elements or entities on the map.
